* Grime Tunes
not ordered by importance or date or literally anything but vibes and my motivation to do this.
i also have no credentials at all to do this ive been into this music for a year or something but i feel like im sufficiently well informed to explain some of it to friends

i try to refer to the date of production when possible, if artists arent listed in a crew or a set its probably because
they havent appeared anywhere else yet and i dont know them well enough to write much.

backlinks with the arrows are a little fucked due to how i automatically insert them idk

Produced by [[id:6ce16e9c-9780-40ce-9911-4c0c700fb86f][Youngstar]], this is probably one of the most well-known and most important grime beats to ever
exist and for sure the most iconic [[id:80502fbb-07f8-4ef8-a180-3f717d0fd037][8-bar]] tune. Heavy bass, 5 minutes of pretty much the same 16-bars,
but people rinse it and the dozens of tracks it inspired (see backlinks). The kick drum/bass sound/whatever is
probably the most iconic bit of it all.

One of the best somewhat more recent [[id:45f6ceee-3145-42da-8afa-4aea5969e23d][Pulse X]]-type riddims. The kick's there,, the "automatic" makes for a
great voice sample, the tonal bweeeh type bass every couple bars makes it singable too somehow.

This was a dubplate until like 2012 when it got released on https://pitchcontrollerrecords.bandcamp.com/album/slk-the-lost-tapes-2.

feels like an early weightless tune given the lack of real drums and all the sfx, absolute banger
though. also has the characteristic youngstar bass, might be the best flirta track, bit more leftfield
than [[id:ba2b4c13-c11e-4501-8535-2958da840179][Warp Speed]] (especially due to flip. riddim. gymnastics).

the things Plastician made back in the day. [[https://twitter.com/Plastician/status/1755725501908304208][Interestingly]] it wasnt played out all that much around its release, more like a classic in hindsight.

he sounds younger in this than even older stuff which is kind of interesting

anyways its the first flowdan solo single, still holds up fairly well imo.

lots of bars in there he still uses, like "i am the big flowdan otherwise known as mr. sandman" or the whole "drive uh drive uh transit van" ordeal i think both of these are in [[id:d6928c15-d8d9-4b9b-8360-c5ca0669a7ef][Horror Show Style]] too

pretty popular roll deep track and just overall fun. mixing kinda sucks but both riddim and overall
vibe make up for it

maybe the most well known instrumental from that time. pretty garagey imo and not as bass focused as one
gets used to in grime, holds up absurdly well though.

nobody really knows who rebound x or the singing woman is afaik, the former just released a couple riddims
on grime forums back in the day and kinda stopped due to reasons i forgot about

made by the [[id:812a48c1-7fa1-485c-b69a-0fd5ebc682a7][SLK]] DJ it mostly feels like another [[id:45f6ceee-3145-42da-8afa-4aea5969e23d][Pulse X]] style tune but its alright. theres lots of dubs of this (see discogs i guess) but most of them are kinda mid

the definite 8-bar rave tune, unbelievable energy. some clubs banned it due to fights occurring and so on, they also cut an entire verse which was basically Hotshot listing gun types and screaming "shoot it" into the mic a dozen times which radio stations didnt really like for some reason (see yt:fa5_YS0z_2Y)

it also lead to the amazing headline [[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/jun/08/davidcameronisadonut][David Cameron is a donut]] which was an opinion piece by [[id:e8d8655b-c8fd-4e82-884f-3be78bc07da1][Lethal Bizzle]] about

the original is way better, so many legends on this but all of their verses are kinda mid (which i guess also applies to the original but it had more texture and feel to it somehow)

aka wiley kat aka eskiboy

the godfather of grime and also the absolute idiot of grime.
got started in the late 90s with garage and dnb on [[id:cecf3e92-5439-4892-ae83-5da3d7715e3a][Rinse.fm]] as far as i know, found his first success with [[id:02c395c1-040e-4767-b645-fc9830dbd612][Pay as U Go Cartel]], then founded [[id:8026c704-3324-4ccf-afa8-ed49e789e6a1][Roll Deep]] and has been more or less
the most well-known member since [[id:35137126-ceaf-41b4-9411-748c987fa834][Dizzee Rascal]] left.

helped a lot of people ([[id:35137126-ceaf-41b4-9411-748c987fa834][Dizzee Rascal]] and [[id:8220134f-151e-4548-b442-47128ee9e2d3][Skepta]]) for example blow up and just seemed to have been
an overall very supportive force in grime.

also got the whole [[id:f636658f-a81e-423d-97ef-ee93384a55aa][Eskibeat]] ordeal started (eskiboy is a nickname he often uses in his songs i guess,
there's a lot of weird themes built around the arctic and ice in his music) and has been one of the most
innovative producers and talented mcs in the game.

however there's also a long history of erratic behavior that made him hard to work with, a fairly
recent and disgusting arc of him being absurdly antisemitic, and assault and burglary
acts a couple years ago so maybe dont pay this guy money i think

honestly he seems mentally very much unwell in ways people dont really acknowledge online but that
doesnt excuse all the horrible shit of course, its kind of similar to the kanye situation though not
quite /that/ bad yet

been in the game since 1994 (according to [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC-pAl-i5UA ][this sets]] description at least), started off with jungle,
later moved on to garage, at some point he joined [[id:374f1c48-1c39-4e9b-9cdf-1374ae49a679][Nasty Crew]] and became probably the most famous mc
of the crew.

often described as your favorite's mc favorite's mc and so on, a lot of grime artists and fans consider him one of, if not the goat. has a lot of characteristic bars and ad libs as well as pretty much absurd
crowd control that lead to him becoming what i think is the mc with the highest [[id:ee996d9c-0fce-4881-acfd-3c84459721d5][reload]] density.

afaik he got somewhat big on the first international [[id:35137126-ceaf-41b4-9411-748c987fa834][Dizzee Rascal]] tour (or at least any of the earlier ones), which he participated in under the condition he could bring [[id:0fd0eac3-09b8-4b79-a5a8-353c02af24a4][Footsie]] and [[id:347cffda-feb5-43dc-9681-5f39c213f2da][Monkstar]] which pretty much lead to the [[id:fe6220b2-4960-491f-8bfe-695903761a60][Newham Generals]] establishing.

moved on to a focus on his solo career and songwriting around 2015 but hes mostly doing drill now and
its all just not very good as much as i would like it to be

also had an ad campaign with ikea??? see [[id:1a6e5545-9b76-48a9-b85d-8088ed09b1a5][D Double E - Fresh n Clean (2019)]]

was originally just called Dee or D or something but the radio station he mced on had another MC D join
at some point so he had to distinguish himself i guess

Lots of classic instrumentals, imo chill and almost melancholic vibes compared to the cold eskibeat sounds
for example, but there's lots of overlap too with tunes like [[id:ffe993e6-d8ae-4a0c-a0ae-f3e01b177be7][Ruff Sqwad - Pied Piper]].

The definite grime album and the international breakthrough for both Dizzee and the genre. Lots of very weird (/pos) beats on here and overall a leftfield and kind of cold atmosphere most grime never was able
to offer, not even [[id:6758cd23-96f2-4de5-9b48-7fbe270e76f2][Wiley]]'s [[id:f636658f-a81e-423d-97ef-ee93384a55aa][Eskibeat]] stuff (though of course that very much influenced the album)

the best plastician work imo, it's more dubstep than it is grime but either way just amazing
atmosphere and constantly on the edge between the warmth of the melancholic melody bits
and the cold bass and grime beats

intensive snare has some of the worst bars ive ever heard from [[id:8220134f-151e-4548-b442-47128ee9e2d3][Skepta]] though that shits just way too
goofy for that track

pretty great! not necessarily a grime album, it's very much mixed with softer garage and even rnb-ish tunes. good vibes though
